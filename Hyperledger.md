# Hyperledger

**Hyperledger Fabric**: an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform
  * a permissioned blockchain network that gets set by the organizations that intend to set up a consortium
  * **members**: the organizations that take part in building the Hyperledger Fabric network

## Software Components
**DOcker images**: server software delivered through Docker images

**Command-Line-Interface(CLI) Tools**: tools used to control the Docker images though configuration files or APIcalls

**Hyperledger Fabric SDKs(NPM packages)**: control the Docker images in much the same way as the CLI tools do
two NPM packages: *fabric-client* and *fablic-client-ca*

**Chaincode Interface(NPM package)**: *fablic-shim*, provides a mechanism for developing smart controls, aka., 
chaincoid, in JavaScript
