* [What is Public-key Cryptography?](https://www.globalsign.com/en/ssl-information-center/what-is-public-key-cryptography)
  - Public-key cryptography (Asymmetric cryptography) that uses two different keys; a public key and a private key.
    + each key performs a unique function. (e.g., the public key is used to encrypt and the private key is used to decrypt.)
  - It is computational infeasible to compute the private key based on the public key.
    + public keys allows users an easy and convenient method for encrypting content and verifying digital signatures
    + private keys allows users to decrypt content and create digital signatures.

  - Digital certificates are issued by entities known as Certificate Authorities(CAs). 

  - Business Application
    + Digital signatures
       - authentication: private key that user owns can be used to apply the signature
       - non-repudiation: private key's owner can't later claim that it was not him/her who applied the signature
       - integrity: even the slightest change to the original document would cause the check to fail
    + SecurityEncryption
       - confidentiality: the intended receipient can decrypt and vie the content encrypted with an individual's public key
       - integrity: decryption process involves verifying that the contents of the original encrypted message
